2. ### Visualisation Menu (Level Selection Style)
Each data structure/algorithm is like a “level”:

- Circular Queue

- Stack

- Tower of Hanoi

- Sorting Land (Bubble, Insertion, etc.)

- Linked List Cave, etc.


Each level/icon could be clickable and take the user to that simulator.

3. ### Circular Queue Level (Example)
- Visual boxes in a circle.

- Front and Rear pointers as arrow images.

- Buttons: Enqueue, Dequeue, Reset

- Animated transitions with messages like “Queue is Full!”

- Maybe show code on the side with a highlighted line on each action.
